# SenecClient
A Client API for connecting to a Senec photovoltaic energy management system

## Goal of the project
The main goal is to provide an API for macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS to check the status of the Senec System.
Additionally, it should be possible to control the system (e.g. by controlling the power plugs, which are provided by the system.)
